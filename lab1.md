# Installing VScode
* The first step to using Java on your computer and remotely connecting for this class is to download VScode. For me, I already have this downloaded, but for those who haven't you will want to visit [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and download the correct version depending on the operating system you're using.

# Remotely Connecting
* Open a new terminal on VScode (if mac user: it's located at the top of the screen - same row as apple logo)

ssh cs15lsp23bu@ieng6.ucsd.edu

and press return (replace cs15lsp23bu with your own username) (windows users will need to install git for windows before this step)
